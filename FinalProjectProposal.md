## Abstract
Last year, when I was about to move to Philadelphia and looking for an ideal apartment,
I wanted to know if the places I had chosen were safe and convenient, and for me, who didn't own a car,
I was also concerned about whether there were public transportation stations near my home and how far it 
was from school. Rent was also what I cared about. In order to get this information, I checked many websites 
and datasets. Finally, I integrated this information, ranked several target apartments, and selected the 
apartment with the best location. As the information is on various websites and datasets, we need to spend 
a lot of time searching for this information. Inspired by the experience, we want to create an application that 
would incorporate some of the information that people care about when moving to a new place, the application aims 
to provide information on public security, public transportation, the number of groceries in the neighborhood, 
the distance to the nearest school, and the housing value. We will use an interactive map to demonstrate the information 
in a well-organized way. When users entering an address in the search bar, the address, the public transportation stations, 
the nearby groceries, parks will be highlighted with different colors and marks on the map. A layer symbolized by crime rate 
will be added to the map and the most frequent types of crime will be listed. The median housing value of the area also will 
be listed by housing types.
